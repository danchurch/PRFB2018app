This is the preliminary bioinformatics to look for fungal reads in the doug fir transcriptome. This was done to test the idea that important information about metabolic activity of the microbiome is present in the body of reads that are normally discarded in host-centered studies. 

The `getData.txt` details the process used to examine the transcriptome for fungal reads. This script is unedited and not generally prepared for public consumption, but careful review can show the methods used to quickly search the conifer genome for the presence of fungal reads. Additionally, what are likely significant differences in the host microbiome metabolism between treatments are found with just this quick check. A simple graphical comparison is found in this repo, over at https://github.com/danchurch/PRFB2018app/blob/master/graphics/png/readBar.png .
