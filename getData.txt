## let's start by trying to get some of Richard Cronn's needle
## data from NCBI/SRA

## following examples from:
https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/Download-On-Demand

## many but not all runs listed at:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP018395

## just starting with one:

## SRA has its own set of command line tools. 

prefetch SRR669789
## while we're at it....
prefetch SRR669871  
prefetch SRR669834  

## where are these going? 

srapath SRR669834  

## how do we get all of the runs or samples associated
## with a project?

tar -xzf edirect.tar.gz

#################

## okay, but what if need genbank gene acessions, not the 
## read libraries?

esearch -db protein -query "lycopene cyclase" | efetch -format fasta

esearch -db protein -query "lycopene cyclase" | efetch -format full -mode json


esearch -db  -query "lignin peroxidase [nt] fungi [ORGN] NOT bacteria [ORGN] " | efetch -format full -mode json

esearch -db nucleotide -query "lignin peroxidase" -spell -field DEFINITION

## plan: 

## check size of Cronn project, see if we have room on this computer to download all. 
##  if not, just grab a couple more to train methods
## get mRNA sequences for them all:

cutinase[All Fields] AND (fungi[filter] AND biomol_mrna[PROP])


## how can we do this with entrez?

## and tonight?
